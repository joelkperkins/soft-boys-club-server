### GET /messages

Get all messages in database sent in last 30 days, limited to 100. Send a `GET` to `/messages` to retrieve all messages. 

```
/**
 * @apiRoute get '/messages' Gets all messages sent by users within 100 days, limited to 100
 *
 * @apiSuccess {object[]} Array of message objects
 */
```

### GET /messages/between?to=&from=

Gets all messages sent between two users within 100 days, limited to 100. Send a `GET` to `/messages?to=<string>&from=<string>` with added url query parameters indicating the users whose conversation you would like to retrieve. 

```
/**

 *
 * @apiQueryParam {string} to - user who recieved the message
 *
 * @apiQueryParam {string} from - user who sent the message

```

### POST /chat

Send a message to another user. Send a `POST` to `/chat` with a body containing the sender, recipient, and message. The message is saved and can be retrieved with the GET routes. 

```
/**
 * @apiRoute POST '/send' Send a chat message to another user
 *
 * @apiBody {object} { to: {string}, from: {string}, message: {string} }
 *
 * @apiSuccess {String} Confirmation of sent message, returns ID of message
 */
```

### PUT /chat/react

React to a message received. Send a `PUT` to `/chat/react` with a body containing the ID of the message to react to and reaction string. This reaction is saved with the message. 

Currently accepted reactions are: 
 > 'like'
 > 'dislike"

```
/**
 * @apiRoute PUT '/react' User reacts to a message they received
 *
 * @apiBody {object} { messageId: <string>, reaction: <string>} Object containing id of message and reaction ('like/dislike')
 *
 * @apiSuccess {String} Number of updated messages
 */
```
